I work as a Research Fellow in Bioinformatics at the Australian Centre for Plant Functional Genomics
([ACPFG](http://www.acpfg.com.au/)) in Adelaide, Australia. Much of my work is covered by IP, so I
have to be somewhat careful with what I post.

The contents of this blog are my own views and opinions.
